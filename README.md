# Interactive AI

This AI-powered web application is designed to provide multiple functionalities such as text chat with an AI assistant, image analysis, AI chef suggestions, voice interaction, language translation, video transcript summarization, and text-to-speech conversion. The application leverages several AI models and services, including Google's Generative AI, ElevenLabs for text-to-speech, AssemblyAI for transcription, and YouTube transcript analysis.

## Features

### 1. Text Chat with AI
Engage in conversations with an AI assistant. The assistant processes user input and generates plain-text responses using Google's Generative AI model.

### 2. Image Analysis
Upload an image and provide a prompt to receive AI-generated responses based on the image. The AI analyzes the image and returns detailed insights or custom responses.

### 3. AI Chef Suggestions
Upload a photo of ingredients, and the AI will suggest dishes you can prepare with those ingredients. The AI also provides step-by-step cooking instructions.

### 4. Voice Interaction
Interact with the AI using voice commands. The AI listens, processes speech, responds in real-time, and plays the response back using text-to-speech.

### 5. Language Translation
Translate text into multiple languages using an integrated translation service. The system supports translations into a wide range of languages, with audio playback for the translated text.

### 6. Video Transcript Summarization
Provide a YouTube video link, and the AI will fetch the transcript and summarize the content using a text generation model.

### 7. Text-to-Speech Conversion
Convert any text into speech using Microsoft's text-to-speech technology and play the resulting audio.
